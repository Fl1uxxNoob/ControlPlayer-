## üóÑÔ∏è Database

The plugin uses SQLite to store command history in `plugins/ControlPlayers/staff_commands.db`. This includes:

- Command executor (Discord user)
- Command type and target

## üîí Security Features

### Permission Levels

1. **Basic Users** (`allowed-users`):
   - Can execute moderation commands
   - Can view player lists and IPs
   - Cannot access command history

2. **History Users** (`history-allowed-users`):
   - All basic permissions
   - Can view staff command history
   - Should only include trusted administrators

### Channel Restrictions

Commands only work in configured channels (`allowed-channels`), preventing unauthorized usage in public channels.

### Audit Trail

All commands are logged with:
- Who executed the command
- When it was executed
- What action was taken
- Server response status

## üé® Customization

### Message Customization

Edit `messages.yml` to customize:
- Error messages and responses
- Embed titles and descriptions
- Field names and footers
- Colors (hex format: #RRGGBB)
- Default values

### Available Placeholders

- `%prefix%` - Discord command prefix
- `%player%` - Target player name
- `%duration%` - Action duration
- `%reason%` - Action reason
- `%staff%` - Staff member name
- `%online%` - Online player count
- `%max%` - Maximum players
- `%ip%` - IP address

## üîÑ Commands & Permissions

### In-Game Permissions

The plugin executes commands through the console, so no specific Minecraft permissions are required. However, ensure your moderation plugins are properly configured.

### Discord Permissions

Ensure your Discord bot has:
- `Send Messages`
- `Embed Links`
- `Use External Emojis`
- `Read Message History`
- `Manage Messages` (optional, for better UX)

## üìä Monitoring & Logs

### Console Logs

The plugin logs important events to the server console:
- Bot connection status
- Command executions
- Database operations
- Error messages

### Database Queries

Access the SQLite database directly for advanced reporting:
```sql
SELECT * FROM staff_commands 
WHERE discord_user_id = 'USER_ID' 
ORDER BY timestamp DESC 
LIMIT 50;
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Bot not responding**:
   - Check bot token in config.yml
   - Verify bot permissions in Discord
   - Check server console for errors

2. **Commands not working**:
   - Verify channel is in `allowed-channels`
   - Check user is in `allowed-users`
   - Ensure correct command syntax

3. **Database errors**:
   - Check file permissions in plugin folder
   - Verify SQLite driver is loaded
   - Check server console for SQL errors

4. **Player not found**:
   - Ensure exact player name spelling
   - Check if player has ever joined the server
   - For IP command, ensure player is online

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging by checking server console output. All database operations and command executions are logged.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Security Notes

- **Never share your Discord bot token**
- **Limit `history-allowed-users` to trusted administrators only**
- **Regularly review command logs for suspicious activity**
- **Use channel restrictions to prevent abuse**
- **Keep the plugin updated for security patches**

The `histstaff` command reveals sensitive information including who executed commands, when they were executed, and against which players. Only grant access to your most trusted staff members.
